#### [selection.style]($updocblocks/Selections/Operating_on_Selections/Content/index)

If *value* is specified, sets the CSS style property with the specified name to the specified value on all selected elements. If *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same style value; otherwise, if *value* is a function, then the function is evaluated for each selected element (in order), being passed the current datum `d` and the current index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The function's return value is then used to set each element's style property. A null value will remove the style property. An optional *priority* may also be specified, either as null or the string "important" (without the exclamation point).

If you want to set several style properties at once, use an object literal like so: `selection.style({'stroke': 'black', 'stroke-width': 2})`

If *value* is not specified, returns the current *computed* value of the specified style property for the first non-null element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element. Note that the computed value may be *different* than the value that was previously set, particularly if the style property was set using a shorthand property (such as the "font" style, which is shorthand for "font-size", "font-face", etc.).
