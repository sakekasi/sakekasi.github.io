#### [selection.remove]($updocblocks/Selections/Operating_on_Selections/Content/index)

Removes the elements in the current selection from the current document. Returns the current selection (the same elements that were removed) which are now “off-screen”, detached from the DOM. Note that there is not currently a dedicated API to add removed elements back to the document; however, you can pass a function to selection.append or selection.insert to re-add elements.
