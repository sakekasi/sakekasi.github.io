#### [selection.append]($updocblocks/Selections/Operating_on_Selections/Content/index)

Appends a new element with the specified *name* as the last child of each element in the current selection, returning a new selection containing the appended elements. Each new element inherits the data of the current elements, if any, in the same manner as [select](Selections#select) for subselections.

The *name* may be specified either as a constant string or as a function that returns the DOM element to append. When the *name* is specified as a string, it may have a namespace prefix of the form "namespace:tag". For example, "svg:text" will create a "text" element in the SVG namespace. By default, D3 supports svg, xhtml, xlink, xml and xmlns namespaces. Additional namespaces can be registered by adding to [d3.ns.prefix](Namespaces#prefix). If no namespace is specified, then the namespace will be inherited from the enclosing element; or, if the name is one of the known prefixes, the corresponding namespace will be used (for example, "svg" implies "svg:svg").
