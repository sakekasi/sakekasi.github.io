#### [selection.sort]($updocblocks/Selections/Operating_on_Selections/Data/index)



Sorts the elements in the current selection according to the *comparator* function, and then re-inserts the document elements to match. Returns the selection.

The comparator function, which defaults to [d3.ascending](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Arrays#d3_ascending), is passed two elements' data *a* and *b* to compare. It should return either a negative, positive, or zero value. If negative, then *a* should be before *b*; if positive, then *a* should be after *b*; otherwise, *a* and *b* are considered equal and the order is arbitrary.

Note that the sort is not guaranteed to be stable; however, it is guaranteed to have the same behavior as your browser's built-in [[sort|https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort]] method on arrays.
