selection.each



Invokes the specified *function* for each element in the current selection, passing in the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context of the current DOM element. This operator is used internally by nearly every other operator, and can be used to invoke arbitrary code for each selected element. The each operator can be used to process selections recursively, by using `d3.select(this)` within the callback function.
