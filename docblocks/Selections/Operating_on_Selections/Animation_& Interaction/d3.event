d3.event



Stores the current event, if any. This global is registered during an event listener callback with the [on](Selections#on) operator. The current event is reset after the listener is notified in a `finally` block. This allows the listener function to have the same form as other operator functions, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`.

The `d3.event` object is a [[DOM event|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/event]] and implements the standard event fields like `timeStamp` and `keyCode` as well as methods like `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`. While you can use the native event's [[pageX|https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.pageX]] and [[pageY|https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.pageY]], it is often more convenient to transform the event position to the local coordinate system of the container that received the event. For example, if you embed an SVG in the normal flow of your page, you may want the event position relative to the top-left corner of the SVG image. If your SVG contains transforms, you might also want to know the position of the event relative to those transforms. Use the [d3.mouse](#d3_mouse) operator for the standard mouse pointer, and use [d3.touches](#d3_touches) for multitouch events on iOS.
