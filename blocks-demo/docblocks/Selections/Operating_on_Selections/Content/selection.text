#### selection.text

The `text` operator is based on the [[textContent|http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#Node3-textContent]] property; setting the text content will replace any existing child elements.

If *value* is specified, sets the text content to the specified value on all selected elements. If *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same text content; otherwise, if *value* is a function, then the function is evaluated for each selected element (in order), being passed the current datum `d` and the current index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The function's return value is then used to set each element's text content. A null value will clear the content.

If *value* is not specified, returns the text content for the first non-null element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.
