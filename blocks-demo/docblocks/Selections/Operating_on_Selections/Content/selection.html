#### [selection.html]($updocblocks/Selections/Operating_on_Selections/Content/index)

The `html` operator is based on the [[innerHTML|http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/apis-in-html-documents.html#innerhtml]] property; setting the inner HTML content will replace any existing child elements. Also, you may prefer to use the `append` or `insert` operators to create HTML content in a data-driven way; this operator is intended for when you want a little bit of HTML, say for rich formatting.

If *value* is specified, sets the inner HTML content to the specified value on all selected elements. If *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same inner HTML content; otherwise, if *value* is a function, then the function is evaluated for each selected element (in order), being passed the current datum `d` and the current index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The function's return value is then used to set each element's inner HTML content. A null value will clear the content.

If *value* is not specified, returns the inner HTML content for the first non-null element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know the selection contains exactly one element.

Note: as its name suggests, selection.html is only supported on HTML elements. SVG elements and other non-HTML elements do not support the innerHTML property, and thus are incompatible with selection.html. Consider using [XMLSerializer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XMLSerializer) to convert a DOM subtree to text. See also the [innersvg polyfill](https://code.google.com/p/innersvg/), which provides a shim to support the innerHTML property on SVG elements.
