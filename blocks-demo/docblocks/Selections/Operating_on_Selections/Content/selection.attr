#### [selection.attr]($updocblocks/Selections/Operating_on_Selections/Content/index)

If *value* is specified, sets the attribute with the specified name to the specified value on all selected elements. If *value* is a constant, then all elements are given the same attribute value; otherwise, if *value* is a function, then the function is evaluated for each selected element (in order), being passed the current datum `d` and the current index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element. The function's return value is then used to set each element's attribute. A null value will remove the specified attribute.

If *value* is not specified, returns the value of the specified attribute for the first non-null element in the selection. This is generally useful only if you know that the selection contains exactly one element.

The specified *name* may have a namespace prefix, such as `xlink:href`, to specify an "href" attribute in the XLink namespace. By default, D3 supports svg, xhtml, xlink, xml, and xmlns namespaces. Additional namespaces can be registered by adding them to [d3.ns.prefix](Namespaces#prefix) using dot notation.

*name* can also be an Object of *name* and *value* attributes.
