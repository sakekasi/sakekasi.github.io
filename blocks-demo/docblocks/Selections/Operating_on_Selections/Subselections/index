### Subselections



Whereas the top-level select methods query the entire document, a selection's [select](Selections#select) and [selectAll](Selections#selectAll) operators restrict queries to descendants of each selected element; we call this "subselection". For example, `d3.selectAll("p").select("b")` returns the first bold ("b") elements in every paragraph ("p") element. Subselecting via selectAll groups elements by ancestor. Thus, `d3.selectAll("p").selectAll("b")` groups by paragraph, while `d3.selectAll("p b")` returns a flat selection. Subselecting via select is similar, but preserves groups and propagates data. Grouping plays an important role in the data join, and functional operators may depend on the numeric index of the current element within its group.
