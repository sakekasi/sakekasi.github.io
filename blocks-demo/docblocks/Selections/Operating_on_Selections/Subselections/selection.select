selection.select



For each element in the current selection, selects the first descendant element that matches the specified *selector* string. If no element matches the specified selector for the current element, the element at the current index will be null in the returned selection; operators (with the exception of [data](Selections#data)) automatically skip null elements, thereby preserving the index of the existing selection. If the current element has associated data, this data is inherited by the returned subselection, and automatically bound to the newly selected elements. If multiple elements match the selector, only the first matching element in document traversal order will be selected.

The *selector* may also be specified as a function that returns an element, or null if there is no matching element. In this case, the specified *selector* is invoked in the same manner as other operator functions, being passed the current datum `d` and index `i`, with the `this` context as the current DOM element.
