selection.transition



Starts a [[transition|Transitions]] for the current selection. Transitions behave much like selections, except operators animate smoothly over time rather than applying instantaneously.

Transitions of the same name are [exclusive per-element](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/transition/). When the new transition starts on a given element, it will interrupt an active transition of the same name on the element, if any. If a *name* is not specified, the empty name (“”) is used. Note that transitions with a zero delay do not start until the next timer tick, which is typically about 17ms after scheduling.
